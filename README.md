# Internship
This repository is created to store notes, links, articles, scripts, codes and any other output that are produced during my internship work at INRIA, Rennes, France starting from January 6, 2017.

Internship title: Simulating energy-aware networks in large-scale distributed systems

The expected outcome of the internship is to propose a flow based energy model and then implement the model on SimGrid (http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/index.php) simulator.
