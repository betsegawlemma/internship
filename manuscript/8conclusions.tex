\label{chapter:conclusions}

In this thesis we aimed at investigating the level of energy estimation accuracy and performance scalability that can be obtained from flow-level energy consumption models. From our packet-level and flow-level comparison experiment result we conclude that a very good estimation accuracy can be obtained form flow-level energy consumption models without affecting their scalability.
