In this thesis, we aimed at investigating the level of energy estimation accuracy and performance scalability that can be obtained from flow-level energy consumption models. In order to achieve this goal we outlined a research method and following this method we designed, implemented, and validated flow-level energy consumption models for SimGrid simulator. 

Using our validation experiments we have shown that the implemented flow-level model registered less than 1\% estimation error and it is also at least 2 times faster than the packet-level model. From these results we can conclude that given accurate simulated time prediction, our flow-level model gives very accurate energy consumption estimation and it is also significantly scalable. 

These findings suggest that, in general, even though flow-level models capture less detail about the reality they model, compared to packet-level models, the loss of detail might not result in significant loss of accuracy.
