\section{Context of the Study}
	 

\section{Problem statement}
Even though there is a growing concern about the energy consumption of large-scale network infrastructures, a search of the literature revealed few studies which address the issue of estimating the energy consumption of these network infrastructures. The existing proposed solutions being packet-level estimators are not scalable (in-terms of memory usage and speed) to be used in the domain of large-scale distributed networks such as cloud, grid, and peer-to-peer computing. 

\section{Aim and Scope}

The purpose of this work is first to propose and to implement flow-level energy consumption model in SimGrid and then to show that the implemented model gives reasonably accurate result and it is also scalable for estimating energy consumption of large-scale distributed networks.

In the domain of large-scale distributed network infrastructure, we can categorize energy consuming components into two broad groups: IT equipments (which includes computing servers, storage servers and networking components) and infrastructure components (which includes power provisioning, cooling and lighting components). Since SimGrid already have energy consumption model for computing servers, the scope of this study is on the network component part within the IT equipments category.
