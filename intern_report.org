** Week 1 January 
   - Emacs installed and tried it, but found it difficult to get myself familiarize with it
   - Tried Spacemacs and noticed that it has VIM mode and found it quite easier to use, therefore, I have decided to use it
   - Tried Org-mode and this file is my first document produced with it
   - Information about integrating Emacs and Spacemacs is found [[http://jr0cket.co.uk/2015/08/spacemacs-first-impressions-from-an-emacs-driven-developer.html][here]]
   - SimGrid installed using the following command on Ubuntu machine
     sudo apt-get install simgrid
   - Tried to read "SimGrid 101" and "SimGrid and MSG 101" using slides available [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials.php][here]] 
   - Found another tutorial [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.14/doc/tutorial.html][here]]  about SimGrid which is very nice because I was able to compile and run SimGrid based on the information provided there. However I met two errors while trying to build Pajeng
     1. the first issue was that flex was missing, solved after running sudo apt-get install flex
     2. the second issue was that bison was missing, solved after running sudo apt-get install bison
   - Started learning Org-mode. I am excited about it and want to go deep into it using the information available on the following links

   - Refreshed my git knowledge watching [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c][this]] video 
   - Important Git commands and concepts
     1. git init
     2. git config --global user.email "email address"
     3. git config --global user.name "user name" 
     4. git status 
     5. git add
     6. git commit -m "some message about the commit"
     7. git commit -a -m "some message about the commit"
     8. git log
     9. git add .
     10. git branch branch_name
     11. git checkout branch_name/master
     12. git clone URLBibliography
     13. git remote
     14. git remote -v
     15. git fetch origin
     16. git pull origin
     17. git push origin master/branch_name
     18. adding .gitignore file
   - Created Git repository named "internship" to store all outputs of my internship
   - Information about using git with spacemacs is found [[https://alxndr.github.io/blog/2015/06/20/getting-started-with-Spacemacs.html][here]]
   - Read [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.15/doc/group__SURF__plugin__energy.html][SimGrid Energy Plugin]] 
   - Read [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials/simgrid-energy-101.pdf][SimGrid Energy 101]] 
   - Read [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.15/doc/group__SURF__plugin__energy.html][SimGrid Energy Plugin Docs]]
**** Questions
   - FLOPS/s is this notation correct in the slide shown in [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials/simgrid-energy-101.pdf][here]]? (floating point operations per second per second?) (compare slide 6/7/8)
   - Is this value <prop id="watt_per_state" value="100.0:120.0:200.0, 93.0:110.0:170.0, 90.0:105.0:150.0" /> found in examples/platforms/energy_platform.xml correct?
**** TODO Work Planned 
   - Continue exploring spacemacs [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFV5EqpZ6_s&list=PLrJ2YN5y27KLhd3yNs2dR8_inqtEiEweE][Spacemacs ABC tutorial]]
   - Continue exploring Org-mode
