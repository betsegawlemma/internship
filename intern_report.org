*** DONE ECOFEN: an End-to-end energy Cost mOdel and simulator For Evaluating power consumption in large-scale Networks
    CLOSED: [2017-01-15 dim. 22:48]
     
      Anne-Cecile et. al. proposed a novel energy cost model and simulator for large scale wired networks. This model first estimates the power consumption of each equipment involved in the network.
      A network equipment such as router and NIC consumes energy during boot, during shutdown and during the working period between these two processes, the later is referred to as E_work and this is
      the energy cost the authors considered in the proposed model. They further characterized the energy consumed during the working period as fixed (E_idle) and variable (E_variable) energy cost. The fixed 
      energy cost, which depends on the equipment type (NIC, router, switch) and the manufacturer, is the energy consumed when the device is in the working period but not actually doing any network 
      transfer task. The variable cost, on the other hand, is the energy consumed while the equipment is in the working period and is also doing some network transfer task. This cost depends on the 
      bandwidth of the port or the interface used in the transfer, the length of time required to do the transfer and the total number of parallel transfers occurring in the device. The energy model in 
      the second step, estimates the total energy cost of the network by summing the E_idle cost of each equipment involved and E_variable cost occurring at each port or interface of the equipment.
      If there are parallel transfers occurring at a given equipment the E_idle cost of the equipment is considered only once.
    
      After proposing the model, the authors have evaluated it by implementing NS2 simulator of the model and also run different experiments such as energy cost of different network topology, the effect
      of varying traffic on energy cost, evaluation of energy saving techniques, and evaluation of energy cost for large scale networks. 

      Even though this study is a foundation work for modeling energy cost of large scale models, further work is required to include to the model the energy cost incurred during boot and shutdown time. 
      In addition, though the authors simulated the energy saving techniques such as ON/OFF technique in their experiments, their proposed model did not include energy saving technique as one of its parameter. 
      Further more, to allow to study the impact of energy saving technique on performance, performance metrics should be incorporated into the model to make it better decision making tool to compare energy
      saving techniques.

      Casanova et. al. in this study explored the design of versatile, scalable, and accurate simulation of distributed applications and platforms in the context of SimGrid simulator. 
      They first explained three basic simulator components common in most popular simulators: simulation model, platform specification and application specification. Simulation model is the component that
      realizes the simulated real-network resources (CPU, Router, Host), the simulated applications which utilize the resources and the progress of the applications. Platform specification is the mechanism
      by which users specify the characteristics of simulated platform. Application specification is the interface which users use to specify the steps and properties of the simulated activities.

   - Found another tutorial [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.14/doc/tutorial.html][here]]  about SimGrid which is very nice because I was able to compile and run SimGrid based on the information provided there. However I met two errors while trying to build Pajeng
     1. the first issue was that flex was missing, solved after running sudo apt-get install flex
     2. the second issue was that bison was missing, solved after running sudo apt-get install bison
   - Started learning Org-mode. I am excited about it and want to go deep into it using the information available on the following links

**** Questions 
     [[file:img/scenario.png]]
     
     Taking the topology shown above (taken from ECOFEN) as an example, the objective of my internship is
     to use the ECOFEN energy model shown below in SimGrid simulator because SimGrid uses flow-based modeling
     
    [[file:img/model.png]] 
    - What I need to add to the above model is, the flow parameters such as bandwidth of the links, and 
      the size of traffic, then model the effect of each flow passing through a given link on the length of time it took to transfer the given traffic
      Is this a correct paraphrase of what I am expected to do in this
      internship? 
      - MQ: It's not really adding things to the models but more
        adapting the model, because some of the thing above are not
        part of the SimGrid view of the platform (eg, ports, network
        cards).
      - MQ: I'd advise to first try to adapt the SimGrid CPU energy
        model to the network, and see whether an instanciation of that
        model could get to the same result than EcoFEN.
      - MQ: Ie, try to get the same result with a brand new (but
        simplistic) model)
    
    - Is there an example in SimGrid which show the flow-based model used in SimGrid in action?
      - MQ: have a look at http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials/surf-101.pdf
