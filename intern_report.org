     2. ECOFEN: an End-to-end energy Cost mOdel and simulator For Evaluating power consumption in large-scale Networks
     
      Anne-Cecile et. al. proposed a novel energy cost model and simulator for large scale wired networks. This model first estimates the power consumption of each equipment involved in the network.
      A network equipment such as router and NIC consumes energy during boot, during shutdown and during the working period between these two processes, the later is referred to as E_work and this is
      the energy cost the authors considered in the proposed model. They further characterized the energy consumed during the working period as fixed (E_idle) and variable (E_variable) energy cost. The fixed 
      energy cost, which depends on the equipment type (NIC, router, switch) and the manufacturer, is the energy consumed when the device is in the working period but not actually doing any network 
      transfer task. The variable cost, on the other hand, is the energy consumed while the equipment is in the working period and is also doing some network transfer task. This cost depends on the 
      bandwidth of the port or the interface used in the transfer, the length of time required to do the transfer and the total number of parallel transfers occurring in the device. The energy model in 
      the second step, estimates the total energy cost of the network by summing the E_idle cost of each equipment involved and E_variable cost occurring at each port or interface of the equipment.
      If there are parallel transfers occurring at a given equipment the E_idle cost of the equipment is considered only once.
    
      After proposing the model, the authors have evaluated it by implementing NS2 simulator of the model and also run different experiments such as energy cost of different network topology, the effect
      of varying traffic on energy cost, evaluation of energy saving techniques, and evaluation of energy cost for large scale networks. 

      Even though this study is a foundation work for modeling energy cost of large scale models, further work is required to include to the model the energy cost incurred during boot and shutdown time. 
      In addition, though the authors simulated the energy saving techniques such as ON/OFF technique in their experiments, their proposed model did not include energy saving technique as one of its parameter. 
      Further more, to allow to study the impact of energy saving technique on performance, performance metrics should be incorporated into the model to make it better decision making tool to compare energy
      saving techniques.

* Journal
** Week 1 January 
   - Emacs installed and tried it, but found it difficult to get myself familiarize with it
   - Tried Spacemacs and noticed that it has VIM mode and found it quite easier to use, therefore, I have decided to use it
   - Tried Org-mode and this file is my first document produced with it
   - Information about integrating Emacs and Spacemacs is found [[http://jr0cket.co.uk/2015/08/spacemacs-first-impressions-from-an-emacs-driven-developer.html][here]]
   - SimGrid installed using the following command on Ubuntu machine
     sudo apt-get install simgrid
   - Tried to read "SimGrid 101" and "SimGrid and MSG 101" using slides available [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials.php][here]] 
   - Found another tutorial [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.14/doc/tutorial.html][here]]  about SimGrid which is very nice because I was able to compile and run SimGrid based on the information provided there. However I met two errors while trying to build Pajeng
     1. the first issue was that flex was missing, solved after running sudo apt-get install flex
     2. the second issue was that bison was missing, solved after running sudo apt-get install bison
   - Started learning Org-mode. I am excited about it and want to go deep into it using the information available on the following links
     1. [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html][Org mode for beginners]]
     2. [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][Org mode tutorial]]

**** Questions
   - FLOPS/s is this notation correct in the slide shown in [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials/simgrid-energy-101.pdf][here]]? (floating point operations per second per second?) (compare slide 6/7/8)
   - Is this value <prop id="watt_per_state" value="100.0:120.0:200.0, 93.0:110.0:170.0, 90.0:105.0:150.0" /> found in examples/platforms/energy_platform.xml correct?
**** TODO Work Planned 
   - Continue exploring spacemacs [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFV5EqpZ6_s&list=PLrJ2YN5y27KLhd3yNs2dR8_inqtEiEweE][Spacemacs ABC tutorial]]
