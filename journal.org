*** Editor
**** Emacs installed and tried it, but found it difficult to get familiarized myself with it
**** Tried Spacemacs and it has VIM mode and found it quite easier to use therefore, I have decided to use it
**** I have tried Org-mode and this file is my first document produced with it
**** [[http://jr0cket.co.uk/2015/08/spacemacs-first-impressions-from-an-emacs-driven-developer.html][Info about integrating Emacs and Spacemacs is found here]]
*** SimGrid
**** Installed it using the following command on Ubuntu machine
     sudo apt-get install simgrid
**** Tried to read "SimGrid 101" and "SimGrid and MSG 101" slides available [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials.php][here]] in order to understand it
**** Also found another tutorial [[http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.14/doc/tutorial.html][here]] which is very nice because I was able to compile and run SimGrid based on the information provided there. However I met two errors and one while trying to build Pajeng
     1. the first issue was that flex was missing, solved after running sudo apt-get install flex
     2. the second issue was that bison was missing, solved after running sudo apt-get install bison
