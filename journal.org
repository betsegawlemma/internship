* Internship started
** DONE Things done on Jan 5 and 6, 2017 <2017-01-06 ven.>
*** Editor
**** Emacs installed and tried it, but found it difficult to get familiarized myself with it
**** Tried Spacemacs and it has VIM mode and found it quite easier to use therefore, I have decided to use it
**** I have tried Org-mode and this file is my first document produced with it
**** Info about integrating Emacs and Spacemacs is found here http://jr0cket.co.uk/2015/08/spacemacs-first-impressions-from-an-emacs-driven-developer.html
*** SimGrid
**** Installed it using the following command on Ubuntu machine
     sudo apt-get install simgrid
**** Tried to read "SimGrid 101" and "SimGrid and MSG 101" slides available at  http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials.php in order to understand it
**** Also found another tutorial at http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.14/doc/tutorial.html which is very nice because I was able to compile and run SimGrid based on the information provided there. However I met two errors and one while trying to build Pajeng
     1. the first issue was that flex was missing, solved after running sudo apt-get install flex
     2. the second issue was that bison was missing, solved after running sudo apt-get install bison
*** Org-mode
**** This is my first org-mode document
**** I have started learning it. I am inspired to go deep into it using the information available on the following links

     2. http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html
